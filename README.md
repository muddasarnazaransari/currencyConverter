# Currency Converter App

## Overview
This is the code of the currency converter app which I created with **React**. React was chosen for its efficient state management, component reusability, and smooth UI rendering. This app can convert entered amounts from one currency to another in a blink of a minute. It supports **200+ currencies**, including common cryptocurrencies & metals. The exchange rate data updates daily. The site is fully responsive and user-friendly, featuring an intuitive layout, accessibility considerations, and optimized performance. Hope you like it!
